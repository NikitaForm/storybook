          <span class="underline">PUBLIC CHARTER OPERATIONS.</span> In the event CHARTERER and CARRIER have filed a public charter prospectus under 14 CFR 380 (“Public Charter Prospectus”) with the DOT and such prospectus was approved, CHARTERER may elect to operate the Flight purchased pursuant to this Agreement as a public charter flight pursuant to 14 CFR 380 (“Public Charter”). In the event CHARTERER chooses to operate the Flight as a Public Charter, CARRIER authorizes CHARTERER to execute an amendment to the Public Charter Prospectus on its behalf and file it with the DOT.
        </li>
        <li class="p-t-15">
          <span class="underline">CHARTER PRICE - DEFINED.</span> CARRIER agrees to charge and CHARTERER agrees to pay the amount listed in the description of the Flight on the Operator Platform for the Flight to be performed on the aircraft or aircraft type designated in the description of the Flight on the Operator Platform (“Aircraft”) for the route listed on the first page of this Agreement (“Charter Price”).  The Charter Price includes all expenses of operating the Aircraft over the designated routing(s), such as crew expenses, crew wait time, cleaning fees, all domestic and international landing and parking fees, fuel, and any related expenses such as Aircraft maintenance costs, CARRIER's liability insurance coverage, and any and all additional international or domestic fees.  The charter price does not include U.S. air transportation excise taxes, segment-fee taxes (collectively “Transportation Taxes”) and de-icing fees.
        </li>
        <li class="p-t-15">
          <span class="underline">CHARTER PRICE - PAYMENT.</span> For the Flight that the Charter did not elect to operate as a Public Charter, CHARTERER shall pay CARRIER the Charter Price on the last business day prior to the Flight. For the Flight that CHARTERER elected to operator as a Public Charter, CHARTERER shall pay the Charter Price to CARRIER at least forty eight (48) hours after but not later than 10 days after the last leg of the flight is completed pursuant to Public Charter regulations via wire transfer of readily available funds.
        </li>
        <li class="p-t-15">
          <span class="underline">FEDERAL EXCISE TAX.</span> CHARTERER acknowledges and agrees that it has engaged CARRIER to operate certain flights to transport CHARTERER’S customers on Aircraft operated by CARRIER. CHARTERER further acknowledgements and agrees that, with respect to all flights and to all passengers transported thereon, it is CHARTERER's sole and exclusive responsibility to collect, account for and pay over to the Internal Revenue Services, all applicable federal excise taxes described in sections 4261 et. seq., and/or sections 4271 et. seq., of the International Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or any successors statutes or provisions), and that CARRIER shall be exempt from having to collect, account for and pay over to any person, entity or governmental agency any of the foregoing taxes and fees.
        </li>
        <li class="p-t-15">
          <span class="underline">WIRELESS INTERNET AND IN-FLIGHT CALLING FEES.</span> Wi-Fi and/or inflight calling are included in the quoted price. CARRIER agrees that CHARTERER shall not be responsible for any additional Wi-Fi or in-flight call charges.

          <span class="underline">STANDARD STOCK AND ADDITIONAL ITEMS.</span> CARRIER shall provide standard stock, such as water, condiments, light refreshments, light snacks, such as chips, cookies, and chocolates, and alcohol minibar on board of the Flight at no additional cost to CHARTERER. CHARTERER reserves the right to provide catering, additional condiments, snacks, and refreshments beyond the standard stock provided by CARRIER, and accessories to be present on the Aircraft during the Flight at its cost and expense.
        </li>
        <li class="p-t-15">
          <span class="underline">FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS.</span> CHARTERER shall have a right to cancel a round trip Flight with no penalty by providing a cancellation notice at least a 24 hours prior to Flight’s departure time during non-peak days and a 72-hour notice prior to Flight’s departure time during peak days. Peak days are defined in Schedule A incorporated in full by this reference. CHARTERER shall not be able to cancel a one-way Flight. CARRIER cannot cancel a Flight once CARRIER accepts the terms of this Agreement. In the event the Flight cannot depart during the departure time as displayed in the Operator’s Portal for any reason other than a Force Majeure event (defined below) that would make it physically impossible to operate the Flight, the Flight shall be considered cancelled by CARRIER for the purposes of this Agreement.
          <p class="p-t-15">
            If CARRIER cancels the Flight for any reason other than as a result of a Force Majeure event, CARRIER shall provide a SUBSTITUTE FLEET AIRCRAFT that shall be available for departure at the same departure time of the Flight or subcontract performance of the Flight to depart at the scheduled departure time of the Flight to the SUBSTITUTE CARRIER at no additional cost to CHARTERER. Upon CARRIER’S request, CHARTERER should assist with sourcing the performance of the Flight to a SUBSTITUTE CARRIER. In the event CARRIER fails to provide a SUBSTITUTE FLEET AIRCRAFT or subcontract performance of the Flight to SUBSTITUTE CARRIER pursuant to this Paragraph, CHARTERER shall have a right to source and contract for the recovery for the Flight based on the prevailing market rate (“Recovery Rate”). CARRIER agrees and acknowledges that it shall be liable to pay to CHARTERER the difference between the Charter Price and the Recovery Rate and grants CHARTERER the right to offset such amount from any amounts that CHARTERER owes to CARRIER.
          </p>
          <p class="p-t-15">
            If CARRIER cancels the Flight as a result of a mechanical issue which makes it is physically impossible for Operator to operate the Flight on the Aircraft, CARRIER must provide to CHARTERER the aircraft log for the Aircraft documenting the mechanical issue (“Aircraft Log”) within 24 hours of its occurrence (“Timeframe”). In the event CARRIER provides CHARTERER with the Aircraft Log within the Timeframe, this Agreement shall be terminated. If CHARTERER paid CARRIER the Charter Price for the cancelled Flight, CARRIER shall promptly, but in no event later than 2 business days after the cancellation, refund the Charter Price to CHARTERER.  In the event CARRIER fails to provide CHARTERER with the Aircraft Log within the Timeframe, the Flight shall be considered cancelled by CARRIER for a reason other than a Force Majeure event and the cancellation penalties listed above shall apply.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="p-t-15">
          <span class="underline">FORCE MAJEURE.</span> In the event CARRIER cannot perform the Flight as a result of a Force Majeure that would make it physically impossible to operate the Flight, the Flight shall be cancelled and neither CARRIER nor CHARTERER shall be liable for payment for the Flight.
          <p class="p-t-15">
            For purposes of the Agreement, “Force Majeure” means an act of God, strike or lockout or other labor dispute, act of a public enemy, war (declared or undeclared), terrorism, blockade, revolution, civil commotion, fire, any weather-related event affecting safety of flight, flood, earthquake, explosion, governmental restraint, or embargo. Aircraft maintenance, including unscheduled maintenance, and crew flight hour limitations/scheduling are not Force Majeure events. Cancellations due to unscheduled, but immediately necessary maintenance shall be governed by Paragraph 8 above.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="p-t-15">
          <span class="underline">FBO.</span> CHARTERER reserves the right to choose the FBO to be used for the Flight.
        </li>
        <li class="p-t-15">
          <span class="underline">TRANSPORTATION OF SERVICE ANIMALS.</span> CARRIER shall abide by the applicable laws and regulations regarding the transportation of service animals. CARRIER shall not charge CHARTERER or CHARTERER’S passengers travelling with a service animal any additional fees including, cleaning or service fees, unless the Service Animal has soiled the aircraft or caused damage to the Aircraft that is beyond reasonable wear and tear. Any assessed cleaning fees for the damages caused by service animals beyond reasonable wear and tear must be supported by photographic evidence of such damage.
        </li>
        <li class="p-t-15">
          <span class="underline">DAMAGE CAUSED BY PASSENGERS.</span> CHARTERER shall reimburse CARRIER for any damage beyond the usual wear and tear to the Aircraft performing the Flight caused by CARRIER’s passengers provided CARRIER (i) documents such damage with photographic evidence; (ii) provides the information on the identity of the passenger who caused the damage; and (iii) provides the photographic evidence of damage to CHARTERER within one day of completion of the Flight.

        <li class="p-t-15">
          <span class="underline">CHARTER PRICE - DEFINED.</span> CARRIER agrees to charge and CHARTERER agrees to pay the amount listed in the description of the Flight on the Operators Platform for the Flight to be performed on the aircraft or aircraft type designated in the description of the Flight on the Operators Platform (“Aircraft”) for the route listed on the first page of this Agreement (“Charter Price”). The Charter Price includes all expenses of operating the Aircraft over the designated routing(s), such as crew expenses, crew wait time, cleaning fees, all domestic and international landing and parking fees, fuel, and any related expenses such as Aircraft maintenance costs, CARRIER's liability insurance coverage, and any and all additional international or domestic fees. The charter price does not include U.S. air transportation excise taxes, segment-fee taxes (collectively “Transportation Taxes”) and de-icing fees.
        </li>
        <li class="p-t-15">
          <span class="underline">CHARTER PRICE - PAYMENT.</span> For the Flight that the Charter did not elect to operate as a Public Charter, CHARTERER shall pay CARRIER the Charter Price on the last business day prior to the Flight. For the Flight that CHARTERER elected to operator as a Public Charter, CHARTERER shall pay the Charter Price to CARRIER at least forty eight (48) hours after but not later than 10 days after the last leg of the flight is completed pursuant to Public Charter regulations via wire transfer of readily available funds.
        </li>
        <li class="p-t-15">
          <span class="underline">FEDERAL EXCISE TAX.</span> CHARTERER acknowledges and agrees that it has engaged CARRIER to operate certain flights to transport CHARTERER’S customers on Aircraft operated by CARRIER. CHARTERER further acknowledgements and agrees that, with respect to all flights and to all passengers transported thereon, it is CHARTERER's sole and exclusive responsibility to collect, account for and pay over to the Internal Revenue Services, all applicable federal excise taxes described in sections 4261 et. seq., and/or sections 4271 et. seq., of the International Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or any successors statutes or provisions), and that CARRIER shall be exempt from having to collect, account for and pay over to any person, entity or governmental agency any of the foregoing taxes and fees.

          <span class="underline">STANDARD STOCK AND ADDITIONAL ITEMS.</span>CARRIER shall provide standard stock, such as water, condiments, light refreshments, light snacks, such as chips, cookies, and chocolates, and alcohol minibar on board of the Flight at no additional cost to CHARTERER. CHARTERER reserves the right to provide catering, additional condiments, snacks, and refreshments beyond the standard stock provided by CARRIER, and accessories to be present on the Aircraft during the Flight at its cost and expense.

Peak days are defined in Schedule A incorporated in full by this reference. CARRIER cannot cancel a Flight once CARRIER accepts the terms of this Agreement. In the event the Flight cannot depart during the departure time as displayed in the Operator’s Portal for any reason other than a Force Majeure event (defined below) that would make it physically impossible to operate the Flight, the Flight shall be considered cancelled by CARRIER for the purposes of this Agreement.
          <p class="p-t-15">
            If CARRIER cancels the Flight for any reason other than as a result of a Force Majeure event, CARRIER shall provide a SUBSTITUTE FLEET AIRCRAFT that shall be available for departure at the same departure time of the Flight or subcontract performance of the Flight to depart at the scheduled departure time of the Flight to the SUBSTITUTE CARRIER at no additional cost to CHARTERER. Upon CARRIER’S request, CHARTERER should assist with sourcing the performance of the Flight to a SUBSTITUTE CARRIER. In the event CARRIER fails to provide a SUBSTITUTE FLEET AIRCRAFT or subcontract performance of the Flight to SUBSTITUTE CARRIER pursuant to this Paragraph, CHARTERER shall have a right to source and contract for the recovery for the Flight based on the prevailing market rate (“Recovery Rate”). CARRIER agrees and acknowledges that it shall be liable to pay to CHARTERER the difference between the Charter Price and the Recovery Rate and grants CHARTERER the right to offset such amount from any amounts that CHARTERER owes to CARRIER.
          </p>
          <p class="p-t-15">
            If CARRIER cancels the Flight as a result of a mechanical issue which makes it is physically impossible for Operator to operate the Flight on the Aircraft, CARRIER must provide to CHARTERER the aircraft log for the Aircraft documenting the mechanical issue (“Aircraft Log”) within 24 hours of its occurrence (“Timeframe”). In the event CARRIER provides CHARTERER with the Aircraft Log within the Timeframe, this Agreement shall be terminated. If CHARTERER paid CARRIER the Charter Price for the cancelled Flight, CARRIER shall promptly, but in no event later than 2 business days after the cancellation, refund the Charter Price to CHARTERER. In the event CARRIER fails to provide CHARTERER with the Aircraft Log within the Timeframe, the Flight shall be considered cancelled by CARRIER for a reason other than a Force Majeure event and the cancellation penalties listed above shall apply.

        </li>
        <li class="p-t-15">
          <span class="underline">FORCE MAJEURE.</span> In the event CARRIER cannot perform the Flight as a result of a Force Majeure that would make it physically impossible to operate the Flight, the Flight shall be cancelled and neither CARRIER nor CHARTERER shall be liable for payment for the Flight.
          <p class="p-t-15">
            For purposes of the Agreement, “Force Majeure” means an act of God, strike or lockout or other labor dispute, act of a public enemy, war (declared or undeclared), terrorism, blockade, revolution, civil commotion, fire, any weather-related event affecting safety of flight, flood, earthquake, explosion, governmental restraint, or embargo. Aircraft maintenance, including unscheduled maintenance, and crew flight hour limitations/scheduling are not Force Majeure events. Cancellations due to unscheduled, but immediately necessary maintenance shall be governed by Paragraph 8 above.

CARRIER shall not charge CHARTERER or CHARTERER’S passengers travelling with a service animal any additional fees including, cleaning or service fees, unless the Service Animal has soiled the aircraft or caused damage to the Aircraft that is beyond reasonable wear and tear. Any assessed cleaning fees for the damages caused by service animals beyond reasonable wear and tear must be supported by photographic evidence of such damage.
        </li>
        <li class="p-t-15">
          <span class="underline">DAMAGE CAUSED BY PASSENGERS.</span>CHARTERER shall reimburse CARRIER for any damage beyond the usual wear and tear to the Aircraft performing the Flight caused by CARRIER’s passengers provided CARRIER (i) documents such damage with photographic evidence; (ii) provides the information on the identity of the passenger who caused the damage; and (iii) provides the photographic evidence of damage to CHARTERER within one day of completion of the Flight.
