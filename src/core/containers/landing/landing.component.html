        <p id="publishFlight">
          Use our Publish Flights product to sell excess capacity on your flights to realize additional revenue. You would provide flight route, departure date, tail number from your Fleet of Aircraft in our system, the number of seats that you would like to offer for sale, and the minimum per-seat price that you would accept. You can choose from Dynamic Pricing or Fixed Pricing. Dynamic Pricing allows the company to increase the price of the seat in an attempt to increase revenue for both parties. Fixed Price is determined by the operator and is inclusive of all commissions and fees except FET, segment and credit card Fees, and will not be modified by XO.

        <p class="smaller disclaimer">
          XO does not guarantee that any seats will be sold. Operator will receive payment only in the event members purchase any seats. Once any seats are purchased, Operator cannot cancel or change flight route, departure time or the aircraft make and model.
