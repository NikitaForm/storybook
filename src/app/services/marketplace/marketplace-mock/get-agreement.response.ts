            JetSmarter Inc., a Delaware Corporation, (CHARTERER) shall purchase and Operator whose name is listed on the first page of this Agreement, (CARRIER) shall furnish the charter air transportation described above subject to the following provisions and the Terms and Conditions appended hereto, which form a part of this Passenger Aircraft Charter Agreement (the Agreement).
            <br>
            <br>
            1.	CHARTERING OF THE AIRCRAFT/FLIGHT DEPARTURE TIME. CARRIER agrees to charter to CHARTERER, and CHARTERER agrees to charter from CARRIER, the flight or flights listed on the first page of this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the applicable laws and regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and all other applicable laws, rules, and regulations of cognizant governmental authorities.  CARRIER and CHARTERER agree to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. CARRIER covenants and agrees that the Flight shall depart during the ALLOTED departure window listed in the Operators Portal. CARRIER shall have no right to adjust or change departure time of the Flight outside of the allotted departure window listed in the Operators Portal.
            <br>
            <br>
            2.	PUBLIC CHARTER OPERATIONS. CHARTERER and CARRIER have filed a public charter prospectus under 14 CFR 380 (Public Charter Prospectus) with the DOT and CHARTERER may elect to operate the flight purchased pursuant to this Agreement as a public charter flight pursuant to 14 CFR 380 (Public Charter). In the event CHARTERER chooses to operate the flight purchased under this Agreement as a Public Charter, CARRIER authorizes CHARTERER to execute an amendment to the Public Charter Prospectus on its behalf and file it with the DOT.
            <br>
            <br>
            3.	CHARTER PRICE - DEFINED. CARRIER agrees to charge and CHARTERER agrees to pay the amount listed on the first page of this Agreement for the flight to be performed on the aircraft designated on the first page of this Agreement (Aircraft) for the route listed on the first page of this Agreement (Charter Price).  The Charter Price includes all expenses of operating the Aircraft over the designated routing(s), such as crew expenses, de-icing, crew wait time, cleaning fees, all domestic and international landing and parking fees, fuel, and any related expenses such as Aircraft maintenance costs, CARRIER's liability insurance coverage, and any and all additional international or domestic fees.  The charter price does not include U.S. air transportation excise taxes, segment-fee taxes, security fees (collectively Transportation Taxes), wireless internet expenses unless wireless internet is included as a feature by CARRIER, and expenses outlined in Paragraphs 6, 11, and 12.
            <br>
            <br>
            4.	CHARTER PRICE - PAYMENT.  CHARTERER shall pay the Charter Price to CARRIER at least forty eight (48) hours after but not later than  4 days after the last leg of the flight is completed pursuant to Public Charter regulations via wire transfer of readily available funds.
            <br>
            <br>
            5.	FEDERAL EXCISE TAX. CHARTERER acknowledges and agrees that it has engaged CARRIER to operate certain flights to transport CHARTERERS customers on Aircraft operated by CARRIER. CHARTERER further acknowledgements and agrees that, with respect to all flights and to all passengers transported thereon, it is CHARTERER's sole and exclusive responsibility to collect, account for and pay over to the Internal Revenue Services, all applicable federal excise taxes described in sections 4261 et. seq., and/or sections 4271 et. seq., of the International Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or any successors statutes or provisions), and that CARRIER shall be exempt from having to collect, account for and pay over to any person, entity or governmental agency any of the foregoing taxes and fees.
            <br>
            <br>
            6.	WIRELESS INTERNET AND IN-FLIGHT CALLING FEES. CARRIER shall disable wireless internet (Wi-Fi) and in-flight calls during the Flight unless (i) Wi-Fi and/or inflight calling are included in the quoted price or (ii) CHARTERER specifically requests in writing to activate the Wi-Fi during the flight. CARRIER agrees that CHARTERER shall not be responsible for any Wi-Fi or in-flight call charges unless it specifically authorized CARRIER to enable Wi-Fi and in flight calling prior to the Flight in writing.
            <br>
            <br>
            7.	STANDARD STOCK AND ADDITIONAL ITEMS. CARRIER shall provide standard stock, such as water, condiments, light refreshments, light snacks, such as chips, cookies, and chocolates, and alcohol minibar on board of the Flight at no additional cost to CHARTERER. CHARTERER reserves the right to provide catering, additional condiments, snacks, and refreshments beyond the standard stock provided by CARRIER, and accessories to be present on the Aircraft during the Flight at its cost and expense.
            <br>
            <br>
            8.	FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS. Neither CARRIER nor CHARTERER can cancel the Flight once CARRIER accepts the terms of this Agreement. In the event the Flight cannot depart during the allotted departure window as displayed in the Operators Portal for any reason other than a Force Majeure event (defined below) that would make it physically impossible to operate the Flight, the Flight shall be considered cancelled by CARRIER for the purposes of this Agreement.

            If CARRIER cancels the Flight for any reason other than as a result of a Force Majeure event, CARRIER shall provide a SUBSTITUTE FLEET AIRCRAFT that shall be available for departure at the same departure time of the Flight or subcontract performance of the Flight to depart at the scheduled departure time of the Flight to the SUBSTITUTE CARRIER at no additional cost to CHARTERER. Upon CARRIERS request, CHARTERER should assist with sourcing the performance of the Flight to a SUBSTITUTE CARRIER. In the event CARRIER fails to provide a SUBSTITUTE FLEET AIRCRAFT or subcontract performance of the Flight to SUBSTITUTE CARRIER pursuant to this Paragraph, CHARTERER shall have a right to source and contract for the recovery for the Flight based on the prevailing market rate (Recovery Rate). CARRIER agrees and acknowledges that it shall be liable to pay to CHARTERER the difference between the Charter Price and the Recovery Rate and grants CHARTERER the right to offset such amount from any amounts that CHARTERER owes to CARRIER.

            If CARRIER cancels the Flight as a result of a mechanical issue which makes it is physically impossible for Operator to operate the Flight on the Aircraft, CARRIER must provide to CHARTERER the aircraft log for the Aircraft documenting the mechanical issue (Aircraft Log) within 8 hours of its occurrence (Timeframe). In the event CARRIER provides CHARTERER with the Aircraft Log within the Timeframe, this Agreement shall be terminated. In the event CARRIER fails to provide CHARTERER with the Aircraft Log within the Timeframe, the Flight shall be considered cancelled by CARRIER for a reason other than a Force Majeure event and the cancellation penalties listed above shall apply.
            <br>
            <br>
            9.	FORCE MAJEURE. In the event CARRIER cannot perform the Flight as a result of a Force Majeure that would make it physically impossible to operate the Flight, the Flight shall be cancelled and neither CARRIER nor CHARTERER shall be liable for payment for the Flight.

            "For" purposes of the Agreement, Force Majeure means an act of God, strike or lockout or other labor dispute, act of a public enemy, war (declared or undeclared), terrorism, blockade, revolution, civil commotion, fire, any weather-related event affecting safety of flight, flood, earthquake, explosion, governmental, FAA or airport restraint or restrictions, or embargo. Aircraft maintenance, including unscheduled maintenance, and crew flight hour limitations/scheduling are not Force Majeure events. Cancellations due to unscheduled, but immediately necessary maintenance shall be governed by Paragraph 8 above. SUBSTITUTE FLEET AIRCRAFT means an aircraft in CARRIERS fleet that is equal or better, in terms of make, model, year of manufacture, interior passenger cabin volume, seating capacity, baggage capacity, and cruising speed, to the aircraft on which the Flight was originally scheduled to be performed. SUBSTITUTE CARRIER is another duly licenses carrier who would perform the flight on an aircraft that is equal or better, in terms of make, model, year of manufacture, interior passenger cabin volume, seating capacity, baggage capacity, and cruising speed, to the aircraft on which the Flight was originally scheduled to be performed.
            <br>
            <br>
            10.	FBO. CHARTERER reserves the right to choose the FBO to be used for the Flight, in which event Charterer must communicate its choice of the FBO to CARRIER upon purchase of the flight. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all flights arriving to or departing from Westchester Airport (HPN) shall depart from or arrive to Ross West FBO located at 67 Tower Road, Hangar T, White Plains, NY 10604 and in the event the Flight originates from or terminates at the home base airport of CARRIER, the Flight shall originate or terminate, as the case may be, in CARRIERS FBO located at the home base provided that CARRIER agrees to taxi to an FBO at which CHARTERER maintains CHARTERERS lounge at no additional cost to CHARTERER.
            <br>
            <br>
            11.	TRANSPORTATION OF SERVICE ANIMALS. CARRIER shall abide by the applicable laws and regulations regarding the transportation of service animals. CARRIER shall not charge CHARTERER or CHARTERERS passengers travelling with a service animal any additional fees including, cleaning or service fees, unless the Service Animal has soiled the aircraft or caused damage to the Aircraft that is beyond reasonable wear and tear. Any assessed cleaning fees for the damages caused by service animals beyond reasonable wear and tear must be supported by photographic evidence of such damage.
            <br>
            <br>
            12.	DAMAGE CAUSED BY PASSENGERS.  CHARTERER shall reimburse CARRIER for any damage beyond the usual wear and tear to the Aircraft performing the Flight caused by CARRIERs passengers provided CARRIER (i) documents such damage with photographic evidence; (ii) provides the information on the identity of the passenger who caused the damage or provides such information regarding the location and type of damage to enable CHARTERER to determine the identity of the passenger who caused the damage; and (iii) provides the photographic evidence of damage to CHARTERER within one day of completion of the Flight.
            <br>
            <br>
            13.	INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.  It is expressly agreed that, CARRIER shall at no expense to CHARTERER maintain aircraft/aviation liability insurance (Policy) with a reputable insurer at all times during the term of this Agreement.  CARRIER shall provide a Certificate of Insurance naming CHARTERER and each of its officers, directors, owners, employees, representatives and customers as additional insureds.  CARRIER must provide to CHARTERER a thirty days advance written notice of Policy cancellation or reduction in liability coverage in the amount of $2,000,000 or more. The Policy shall include the following:

                (a)	The Policy shall include aviation liability, passenger liability, public liability, and property damage liability, providing coverage for all claims resulting from use, and/or operation of the Aircraft including but not limited to claims of death or injury to persons or loss of or damage to property. The Policy shall have a combined single liability limit of not less than one hundred million US dollars ($50,000,000).

                (b)	The Policy shall include War Risk Liability coverage in an amount not less than $50,000,000 per occurrence and in aggregate;

                (e)	The Policy shall include a Waiver of Subrogation clause in the CHARTERERs favor; and

                (f)	The Policy shall apply to any and all aircraft utilized under the terms of this Agreement with CHARTERER.
            <br>
            <br>
            14.	OPERATING REQUIREMENTS.  CARRIER shall not operate a flight, and CHARTERER shall have no obligation (financial or otherwise), during the Term unless the insurance described above is in full force and effect, nor shall CARRIER operate a flight in a location or any manner that would cause such insurance to be suspended, impaired, or canceled, or its protection to be jeopardized.
            <br>
            <br>
            15.	INDEMNIFICATION.  CARRIER shall agree to defend, indemnify, release, and hold harmless CHARTERER, its parent and affiliated companies, their managers, agents, employees, officers, directors and subsidiaries from and against any Claims arising directly or indirectly, out of or from or on account of CARRIERs (i) operation of the Flight; (ii) negligence, misconduct or breach of this Agreement by CARRIER, its parent and affiliated companies, their managers, agents, employees, officers, directors and subsidiaries or (iii) resulting from or in connection with loss of life, bodily injury or damages to property, including but not limited to baggage (and any other guest property that might be transported by CARRIER) arising during flights or carriage of passengers by CARRIER pursuant to this Agreement or arising out of or from or on account of the negligence, misconduct or breach of this Agreement by Carrier.

Subject to the Indemnitees reasonable determination that its interest are prejudiced, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to direct the defense and settlement of any claim for which indemnification is sought under this Agreement.

            <br>
            20.	ARBITRATION.
